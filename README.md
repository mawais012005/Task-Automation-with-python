# Task-Automation-with-python

To use the Python script, no additional dependencies are required as it relies solely on the standard library. Simply execute the script by running python file_organizer.py in your terminal. You can customize the source directory and choose the desired organization method to suit your needs. For further enhancements, consider extending the scriptâ€™s functionality by implementing scheduling capabilities or adding more file categories for better organization. If you're working on a portfolio project, you could also incorporate animations to make it more engaging, build a proper backend for handling contact form submissions, or introduce project filtering features to improve user experience. These additions can significantly enhance both the script's utility and the overall interactivity of your projects.
